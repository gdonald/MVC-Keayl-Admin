# Filters and search

Filters are declared by hand. Each `filter` names a column, a type, and
optionally a predicate and a collection. Nothing is inferred, and no filter ever
enumerates a whole table into a dropdown.

```raku
filter('title',      :as<string>);                 # defaults to a substring search
filter('views',      :as<numeric>, :predicate<gteq>);
filter('published',  :as<boolean>);
filter('created-at', :as<date-range>);
filter('author-id',  :as<select>, :collection({ Author.all.map({ .id => .name }) }));
```

## Predicates

The query builder compiles a predicate onto the ORM relation, composing with the
current sort and pagination. Available predicates:

`eq`, `not-eq`, `cont`, `starts`, `ends`, `gt`, `gteq`, `lt`, `lteq`, `in`,
`between`, `present`, `blank`, `true`, `false`.

`cont`/`starts`/`ends` use SQL `LIKE` (through `ORM::ActiveRecord`'s
`LikePredicate`); the comparisons use ranges; `in` takes a comma-separated list;
`between` takes two comma-separated bounds.

Each filter type has a default predicate, overridable with `:predicate`:

| Type         | Default predicate |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| `string`     | `cont`            |
| `numeric`    | `eq`              |
| `boolean`    | `eq`              |
| `date`       | `eq`              |
| `date-range` | `between`         |
| `select`     | `eq`              |

## Inputs

Each filter renders a type-appropriate input in the filter form: a text box for
`string`, a number box for `numeric`, an Any/Yes/No select for `boolean`, a date
picker for `date`, a pair of date pickers for `date-range`, and a dropdown for
`select`.

A `select` (or association) filter renders a dropdown only from an explicit
`collection`. Without a collection it falls back to a text search, so a large
table is never enumerated. A `select` declared with neither a `collection` nor a
search predicate is rejected at registration time.

## The filter UI

A **Filters** button opens an offcanvas panel holding the form. Applying it
issues an `hx-get` that swaps the index body in place, preserving the current
sort. Active filters appear above the table as removable chips, with a
**Clear all** control. The filter values live in the query string, so a filtered
view is a shareable URL, and sort and pagination links carry the active filters.
