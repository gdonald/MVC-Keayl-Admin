# Installation

Add `MVC::Keayl::Admin` to your application's dependencies and install it. It
brings the vendored Bootstrap and HTMX assets with it.

## Install the admin

The generators ship as a `keayl-admin` command. From your application root:

```
keayl-admin generate admin:install
```

This:

- mounts the engine in `config/routes.raku` (`mount MVC::Keayl::Admin.endpoint, at => '/admin'`),
- writes `config/initializers/admin.raku` with a `configure` call for the site
  title and mount path,
- writes an `app/admin/dashboard.raku` dashboard block stub,
- writes a `config/initializers/admin_authentication.raku` authentication stub,
- generates parallel `t/` and `specs/` coverage that the admin engine mounts.

The mount is idempotent: running install again does not duplicate it.

## Generate an admin for a model

```
keayl-admin generate admin Post
```

The generator introspects the model's schema at generate time and emits an
explicit registration at `app/admin/post.raku` with a `column`, `field`, and
`filter` for each column, and a `permit` of the editable attributes (the primary
key and timestamps are left out of the editable set). Field and filter types
follow the column types. Because the file is explicit, edit it freely afterward.
Parallel `t/` and `specs/` coverage is generated alongside it.

## Mounting by hand

If you prefer to wire things up yourself, mounting is a single line in your
routes. See [Mounting](mounting.md) and [Registering resources](registration.md).
